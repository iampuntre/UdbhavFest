# UdbhavFest
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Follow the steps below
<ul>
<li>Copy all the contents into the web directory (say into htdocs)</li>
<li>Open the project folder and make necessary changes to the connect.php</li>
<li>create a database 'udbhav' in phpmyadmin. upload the udbhav.sql file included. </li>
</ul>
And it's done. Visit http://localhost/project/index.php. You can use this for your mini project. I have done the frontend 
for the entire project. For the backend, I took the help of two friends. Feel free to use this.I hope you can figure out the ER 
diagram for the database on your own. Cheers :)
